# Adminer for OctoberCMS

## Introduction
This plugin creates a private instance of [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) in October backend.

## What is Adminer?
[Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) is a database management tool (written in PHP).

Currently supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL (and many more). It's a fast and light-weight alternative to phpMyAdmin ([more info on this](https://www.adminer.org/en/phpmyadmin/)).

## Installation
In your OctoberCMS backend, go to Updates > Install plugins and search for "martin.adminer" or install from October Marketplace.

## Usage
Click on the toolbar button and manually insert your database credentials.

## Security
You need to be logged on October Backend to access Adminer.

Also, you can give permissions to your backend users but remember, they are going to have access to the whole October database (or databases, depends on your db user privileges).

## Future
The plugin is fully functional but i'm open to suggestions/ideas.
